This is an easy to use serial driver for the Pololu Qik 2s12v10 Duel motor controller.
Ive tested it on a Raspberry Pi Zero in a tank body.

Ease of use.
Just create the QIK object then use it, ive included a main.cpp that demos some move commands.

To compile just use:  g++ main.cpp qik.cpp -o test
